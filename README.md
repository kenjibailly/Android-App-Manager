# How does it work?

Add a remote json link in the settings with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Icon Manager",
    "apkUrl": "https://website.com/app.apk",
    "appIconUrl": "https://website.com/app_icon.png",
    "version": "1.0",
    "packageName": "com.website.app"
  }
]
```

Apps will show up on the home page, you can then download the apk if not installed, or update them when a new version is available.
